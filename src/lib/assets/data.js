                I have worked my way through multiple projects with NodeJs and Express framework, with MongoDB being my favorite choice 
                of database (but I can make use of SQLite if needa be a relational database ðŸ˜Ž). On other other hand I also have plenty experiences with Embedded Systems, specifically with 
                nxp's LPC1549 development board and the Raspberry Pi's Pico W. I have familiarized myself with most important communication protocols: UART, I2C, Modbus RTU, MQTT
