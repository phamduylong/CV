                `Junior year IT student at Metropolia University Of Applied Sciences. Passionate about Web Development on both front-end and back-end.
                I have worked with Svelte and SvelteKit mainly on the front-end side (this whole page itself was built with SvelteKit). On the server side of things,
                I have worked my way through multiple projects with NodeJs and Express framework, with MongoDB being my favorite choice 
                of database (but I can make use of SQLite if needa be a relation database ðŸ˜Ž). On other other hand I also plenty experiences with Embedded Systems, specifically with 
                nxp's LPC1549 development board and the Raspberry Pi Pico W. I have familiarized myself with most important communication protocols: UART, I2C, Modbus RTU, MQTT
                and can work around them without much problem.`

                Fan speed inside the duct can be controlled with Produal MIO 12V Actuator, while pressure difference between the inside and outside of the duct 
                will be measured with Sensirion's SDP600 differential pressure sensor. The idea of the system is to measure surrounding environments attributes, 
                specifically CO2 level, relative humidity and temperature, then using the collected information as a feedback for the ventilation fan 
                to adjust power level so as to create the ideal state in terms of air conditions. I contributed to building the back-end server for the project,
                where we takes data from the physical devices through MQTT, visualize it with Chart.js and creating a User Interface so as to interact with the devices remotely.<br/>
